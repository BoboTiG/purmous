=== Some explications with examples ===
Scenario 1 : 
	"I am running Debian GNU/Linux and want to purge my Windows XP which 
	is located to /dev/sda2 and mounted into /mnt/windows.
	How can I do this man ??"
	=> For a 'normal' purgation, you can try :
		perl purmous -p /mnt/windows xp
	
	"o_O It is so cool! And what will happen then ?"
	=> purmous will check the the partition mounted into /mnt/windows
	as Windows XP to find out temporary files located into specific
	folders.
	Then it will show a summary where you can see how many files have 
	been found and the total weight.
	Finally, it will ask if you want to process to the deletion, by 
	default, it will do nothing.
	
	"Amaziiing !!!"
	=> Thank you xD
	
	"But is it possible to know what are the 'specific folders' in which
	the tool will looking for ?"
	=> Sure. For Windows XP :
		perl purmous -i xp
	
	"Ok nice. Is it over ?"
	=> A little last thing, you have an 'audit mode' enabled by the '-a'
	option. It will append a file purmous_audit_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.log 
	where all files found will be logged into with the total weight.
	Then the tool will exit, no deletion here.
	A verbosity option ('-V') is also available to print all files 
	found and ask for deletion.
	Examples :
		perl purmous -p /mnt/windows xp -a
		perl purmous -p /mnt/windows xp -V

Scenario 2 :
	"Can I purge the local file system ?"
	=> Yes, (we|you) can !
	Just imagine you are running Windows Seven on D:, try this :
		perl purmous -p D: seven
